## About Next Release

Our team is focused on making teams more effective
through change management. We help teams overcome communication
barriers and improve alignment on changes.

We’re a Michigan based company serving teams around the world.

## Our Mission

To develop technologies that enable teams to effectively communicate changes
to their communities in the right place, at the right time, with the
ultimate goal of connecting every community member to the changes important to them.

Effective communication is critical for teams
to be successful. Unfortunately, there is a lot of noise, and it’s
hard to determine what really matters. It doesn't have to be that way.

By helping teams automate capturing the most essential parts of
what has been achieved in their most recent releases, we give
people the best insights to what has been accomplished, without all the pain.
In short, we help teams communicate
changes and get the feedback they need to build their communities.

New releases are the most critical recurring event within an
organization - our goal is to make every one a success.

## Who We Are

We’re a team that believes in execution and accomplishments over expertise;
We care more about how effective you are at translating your existing knowledge
into results, and an unwavering drive to continuously improve yourself, bringing
more success to the mission.

### What We Do

We care about making product releases a success because better releases mean
less stress, more time for solving challenging problems, better team relationships,
and better communities.

When release documentation is easy, developers develop, product managers engage
with customers, QA teams know what needs to be tested, customer support knows
what customers need to be prepared for, sales teams are more effective, marketing
knows what’s really going to be launched, and users know what changes have been made
and why they should install the latest update. Our release note generators and
distribution platform provide each of these stakeholders with information on the changes
that matter to them, when they need it.

### Our Daily Values

We’re looking for people who align with our principal framework.

#### Team, Teammates, Self - The Narwhal Family

We put the success and wellbeing of the Narwhal family above the individual. We put the
success and wellbeing of our team members above our own. We are coaches and students.
We succeed as a team and fail as a team.

#### 10x Thinking & Measuring What Matters

The best work is done when we all align behind a set of objectives that enable
us to set personal objectives that force growth. We recognize that greatness
takes grit and only comes to those who think and act ten times larger than their
competition.

We work to define our objectives, track our progress based on movement towards
key results, and keep persisting after everyone else has gone home and nobody
is watching. It is our duty to achieve success for our teammates.

#### Transparency

We know that having a false sense of reality is the quickest way to demise. That
is why we advocate transparency and consciously reject silos and barriers. Knowing
the reality of the here and now is a superpower that enables every team member to
most effectively support the team, help their team members grow, and know where
they need to be improving themselves.

#### What’s Next

We have an unyielding passion to grow, to improve, and to find new opportunities
to help others.

Once we meet an objective, we view it as having won the opportunity to play the
game again and find new horizons we can cross.
