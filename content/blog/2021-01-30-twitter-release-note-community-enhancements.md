If you haven’t started [following us](https://twitter.com/nextreleaseio)
already, join the 300+ other release note community members who stay
updated on software releases using our Twitter stream. We updated our
release note analysis algorithms to improve the identification of releases
made by teams across Twitter so that regardless of when a release goes out,
we’ll like it. We then retweet release notes when:

-   A changelog receives above-average positive engagement
-   The release note does a stellar job of communicating updates
-   The update has critical information around security

You can see the latest changelogs from across Twitter by visiting
our new [Twitter release note community page](https://www.nextrelease.io/twitter-community/showcase).
Our goal is to facilitate the growth of the changelog community across
the web.

Check out our growing number of sub-communities that love release notes:
