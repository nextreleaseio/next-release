We recently released a dashboard showcasing your development team’s performance
at the organization level. The dashboard has its limits and doesn’t allow you
to dig into how specific projects or team members are contributing to the overall
performance of your organization. Without more granular insights it’s difficult
to determine where which projects are struggling the most, what languages &
frameworks have the largest gaps, or which team members need additional support.
To help dig into the causes behind your organization's performance metrics, we've
added project-level performance metrics.

To understand how each project impacts the wider company numbers, you can navigate
to a specific project, select settings, and click on the Metrics tab.
