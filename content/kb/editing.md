Next Release populates your release notes with every pull request your team has made.

But sometimes that's a little _too much_ information. Next Release lets you edit, add, and remove the entries on your
release notes, plus add custom summaries to add additional long-form text.

All of our release notes support full markdown, and you can include live GitHub references with `@username` or `#issue`.

Click “Edit” at the bottom of the release you want to edit.
